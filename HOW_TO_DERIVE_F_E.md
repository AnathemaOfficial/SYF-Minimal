# How to Derive F and E

This document describes an observation-only methodology.

## Constraints

- No oracle
- No prediction
- No optimization
- No feedback into the system

## Requirements

F and E must be derived from measurable, external signals.

SYF does not define how signals are chosen.

If derivation cannot be explained deterministically,
it must not be used.
