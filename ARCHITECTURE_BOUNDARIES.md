# Canonical Architecture Boundaries

This document defines strict, non-negotiable boundaries between the components of the SYF / Anathema ecosystem.

These boundaries are architectural laws.  
They are not guidelines, intentions, or suggestions.

---

### 1. SYF-Core — Law Layer

#### Role  
SYF-Core defines the mathematical law of impossibility.  

It specifies abstract invariants (ℐ) and systemic constraints that determine  
what must not be representable in any compliant system.  

#### Contains  
- Pure mathematical definitions  
- Abstract invariants  
- Deterministic relations  
- Proof-of-Math (PoM) reasoning  

#### Explicitly Excludes  
- Thermodynamics  
- Physics  
- Hardware assumptions  
- Machines or agents  
- AI, learning, or prediction  
- Optimization  
- Deployment or usage scenarios  
- Governance or configuration  

**SYF-Core is valid on paper, on silicon, or on an unknown future substrate.**

### 2. SYF-Lab — Exploratory Layer

#### Role  
SYF-Lab is a non-authoritative exploration space.  

It may contain interpretations, variants, thought experiments, or alternative readings  
of SYF concepts — without affecting the law.  

#### Contains  
- Conceptual explorations  
- Alternative formulations  
- Readings and experiments  

#### Explicitly Excludes  
- Canonical authority  
- Modifications to SYF-Core  
- Binding specifications  

**Nothing in SYF-Lab alters the meaning, scope, or validity of SYF-Core.**

### 3. SYF-Minimal — PoM Existence Proof

#### Role  
SYF-Minimal provides a minimal executable proof that SYF-Core invariants  
can be instantiated without ambiguity.  

It is not a product and not an optimization target.  

#### Contains  
- Minimal deterministic implementation  
- Proof-of-executability  
- Reduced surface area  

#### Explicitly Excludes  
- Performance optimizations  
- Feature expansion  
- Real-world deployment  
- Productization  

**SYF-Minimal exists to prove possibility, not to enable usage.**

### 4. Anathema-Breaker — Machine Layer

#### Role  
Anathema-Breaker (including SYF-Gate and SYF-Shield) contains machines that consume SYF-Core.  

These systems enforce SYF invariants at the point of action.  

#### Contains  
- Action gating  
- Capacity separation  
- Fail-closed mechanisms  
- Defensive enforcement  

#### Explicitly Excludes  
- Modifications to SYF-Core  
- Redefinition of invariants  
- Authority over the law layer  

**Machines consume the law. They never redefine it.**

---

### 5. Thermodynamic / Physical Interpretations (e.g. La ROCHE)

#### Role  
Thermodynamics and physical substrates are external readings of SYF.  

They may be used to validate or instantiate SYF invariants in specific architectures  
but are never prerequisites of SYF-Core.  

#### Explicitly Excludes  
- Dependency of SYF-Core on physics  
- Embedding physical assumptions into the law  

**Physics may enforce the law.  
The law does not depend on physics.**

---

### Canonical Doctrine  

SYF-Core defines what is impossible.  
Machines construct worlds where the impossible cannot be represented.  
Interpretations do not redefine laws.  

---

### Contribution Rule (Absolute)  

Any contribution that violates these boundaries  
must be rejected by construction, without discussion.
